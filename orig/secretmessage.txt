Came back again to make it clear that
He never said it would meet demand
Shame on a martyr claiming friends from
Either perspective of &

Weak & Strong &
Wet & Dry &
Right & Wrong &
Live & Die &
Sane & Gone &
Love & Not &
All the &s that we forgot

So sing while you hear it, don't deny it
Leave if you can't stand the thought of it
Come back again to make things stand
With no disrespect to the &

High & Low &
New & Old &
Stop & Go &
Hot & Cold &
John & Yoko
Dark & Light
It's almost time to say goodnight to it

They took a lesson from their fathers
Told them that they were the same command
Wait for their minds to make complete
Their lives stuck beside every &

Words & Numbers
Sound & Silence
Stop the peace &
Keep the violence
No & Yes &
We digress
It lives with sad & happiness, Oh God

Big bad Betty of the 'pocalypse
She opens her lips & it goes like this
When the golden rule & the jungle meet
There'll be nothing to love & there'll be no one to beat
Oh, the things we know, the things we don't
Oh, the things we think we can will & won't
We're loath to gather & nothing's left
We're all together & we're all bereft
Capitalists, communists
You did the hokey-pokey & it went like this
You hate each other & you love yourselves
It might be heaven & it might be hell
Oh, the things we do
The things we say
Oh, the things we wish we could wash away
